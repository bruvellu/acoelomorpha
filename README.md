Summary
-------

Little is known about the dynamics of gene expression during development in non-model organisms. Availability of next-generation sequencing allows a high-throughput sampling of transcripts and a more complete view of gene activity. Profiling the gene expression of Priapulus caudatus can provide interesting data for comparisons with model ecdysozoans such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans.

* Which genes change their expression levels over time?
* Does the dynamics reflect any developmental event?
* Are the gene expression levels congruent with the in situ hybridizations?
* What kind of genes are there?


* Brief summary of your analysis goals.
* Experimental design (structure of replication, what tissues you sampled, how many libraries you have, how long the reads are and how many reads there are).
