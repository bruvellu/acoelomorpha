Phylogenomics of Acoelomorpha
=============================

**Objective:** solve the phylogenetic position of acoels and nemertodermatids.

**Progress:**
- Developed a script/module to search and filter SRA records.
- Searched and got a list of SRA packages.
- Tested workflow with a few organisms.
- Defined curation criteria: if unique, yes; if multiple, pick mixed tissues; if
  tissue specific, merge multiple until 40M reads.
- Running assemblies.

**Plan:**
- Continue building assemblies.
- Solve issues like quality offset, no rRNA, too large samples, multiple
  samples.
- Define list of additional RNAseq assemblies.
- Define list of additional genomic assemblies.
- Study phylogenetics.
